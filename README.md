For the HR Report/Dashboard of the Power BI:    

This power BI  will take you to the Power Query environment where we can have our data transformed and then load it to the Power BI module for further analysis and perfect visualization.

In this Power BI , we will create HR using a report/dashboard with very dirty and rough data we got in CSV. Power Query will help you make the data clean and easy to use for analysis.

Power BI will help you create advance reports and dashboards. To create interactive and advanced reports and dashboards.
